- Rewrite the instance pass in order to use the CommandBuffer. Use the updated system in order to simplify rendering into a much smaller pipeline.
- Write map structure that along with polygons for the collision zone. 
- Editor needs to be rewritten as tiles are not the name of the game anymore

:: Ideas with things I may want to add.
- sprite stacking to give the game a unique look. (Sprite instancing is already baked in)


@todo:cs rewrite the entire shader system. It can just be one simple monolithic shader for all things :L

Idea for the game specific stuff.
:: I dont know what exactly I want the seperation to be. I keep going back and forth on setting up lua for the game, and then just expose
several custom lua apis. The thing is how many things do I want to make with this engine?...

:: I think this may be my way out?

Make a Multiengine tool-package.
