- Rewrite the instance pass in order to use the CommandBuffer. Use the updated system in order to simplify rendering into a much smaller pipeline.
- Write map structure that along with polygons for the collision zone. 
- Editor needs to be rewritten as tiles are not the name of the game anymore

:: Ideas with things I may want to add.
- sprite stacking to give the game a unique look. (Sprite instancing is already baked in)
